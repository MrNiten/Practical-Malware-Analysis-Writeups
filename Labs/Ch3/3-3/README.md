# Lab Questions
1. What do you notice when monitoring this malware with Process
Explorer?
2. Can you identify any live memory modifications?
3. What are the malwareâ€™s host-based indicators?
4. What is the purpose of this program?
# Answers
1. The malware executes, spawns a sub process (svchost.exe), and finally kills its own process. svchost is normally a subprocess of services.exe, so seeing it on its own is cause for suspicion.
2. With process explorer we can see that the strings change between the image and memory views. The program is modifying its memory during execution.
3. The malware creates and writes to a file named practicalmalwareanalysis.log. This is the host based indicator.
4. This is a key logger. Anything key pressed after having opened the malware can be found in the log file.
