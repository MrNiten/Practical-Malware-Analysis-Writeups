# Answers
**I had to setup a windows xp virtual machine to get this lab to finally work properly and find tools that would work in that environment. I'll use that machine going forward given the time period these labs were created. 
1. Using rundll32.exe which ships with windows you can provide a DLL as the argument and any of that DLLs exported functions. You can make the malware install like so: >rundll32.exe [DLL], installA.
2. With regshot we can see that installA installed a service called "IPRIP" so we can run the malware with >net start IPRIP.
3. The malware adds registry keys under than name "IPRIP" in HKLM/SYSYEM/ControlSet001/Services and HKLM/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Sevices, and a service called IPRIP. These are the host based indicators.
4. The malware attempts to connect to the url "practicalmalwareanalysis.com". This is the network based signature.
