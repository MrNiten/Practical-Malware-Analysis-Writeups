# Answers
**I had to setup a windows xp virtual machine to get this lab to finally work properly and find tools that would work in that environment. I'll use that machine going forward given the time period these labs were created. 
1. Using rundll32.exe which ships with windows you can provide a DLL as the argument and any of that DLLs exported functions. You can make the malware install like so: >rundll32.exe [DLL], installA.
2. With regshot we can see that installA installed a service called "IPRIP" so we can run the malware with >net start IPRIP.
3. One way is to start the service and use >sc queryex IPRIP to make windows tell which process it's running under. IT runs through the svchost executable which is the windows system process responsible for hosting services.
4. You can add the generic event class process, file system, and registry filters and then use the path contains filters to look for anything with the registry value and path of the lab lab DLL.
5. The malware adds registry keys under than name "IPRIP" in HKLM/SYSYEM/ControlSet001/Services and HKLM/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Sevices, and a service called IPRIP. These are the host based indicators.
6. The malware attempts to connect to the url "practicalmalwareanalysis.com". This is the network based signature.
