# Lab Questions
1. Upload the Lab01-03.exe file to http://www.VirusTotal.com/. Does it match
any existing antivirus definitions?
2. Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so,
what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.
3. Do any imports hint at this programâ€™s functionality? If so, which imports
are they and what do they tell you?
4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this
malware on infected machines?

# Answers
1. Yes, this matches several signatures.
2. Exeinfo says this is packed but does not say with what. The program has two imports which is common for packed programs. With my current level of knowledge I wouldn't be able to unpack this.
3. The imports don't give away anything other than that the program will Load some libraries and the address of a DLL function or variable.
4. That information is not available without unpacking the program.
