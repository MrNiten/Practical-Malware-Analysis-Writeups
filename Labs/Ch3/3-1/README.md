# Lab Questions
1. What are this malware’s imports and strings?
2. What are the malware’s host-based indicators?
3. Are there any useful network-based signatures for this malware? If so, what are they?

# Answers
1. For the sake of brevity, I'm not going to include everything that the strings program returns, just the interesting bits:
```
Rich
.text
`.data <these weren't garabge data so I included them>

ExitProcess <the ExitProcess function>

kernel32.dll <very important windows library>
ws2_32 <part of the windows api, responsible for many network functions>

CONNECT %s:%i HTTP/1.0 <part of a command>

QSRW <probably nothing>

?503 <likely the Service Unavailable http response code>
200 <likely the OK http response code>

f5 
f3 <are these in reference to the function keys on the keyboard?>

^-m-m<|<|<|M <could but nothing but unsure>

advapi32
ntdll
user32 <more winAPI libraries>

StubPath

SOFTWARE\Classes\http\shell\open\commandV
Software\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\ <registry keys>

test

www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com <url the malware will connect to>

admin
VideoDriver
WinVMX32-

vmx32to64.exe <an executable file, likely a host based indicator, maybe it gets downloaded by the malware>

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell <more registry keys>

Folders

AppData <folder on windows systems where lots of data specific to installed programs is stored>
```
As for imports we have one, ExitProcess from the kernel32 library. 

2. The vmx32to64 executable file the malware downloads, the registry keys the malware creates
3. The malware connects to the url www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com
