3. Are there other ways to run this program?

# Answers
1. Several things according to process monitor. Lots of registry operations. The most observable change is that the lab executable gets deleted.
2. The program doesn't seem to do much on its own. The strings suggest that command line arguments could be necessary.
3. There are but they don't seem to be enough to determine what this program does using only basic tools. The arguments prevent the program being deleted at least.
