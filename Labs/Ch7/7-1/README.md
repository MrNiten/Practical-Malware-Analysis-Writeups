# Lab Questions
1. How does this program ensure that it continues running (achieves persistence) when the computer is restarted?
2. Why does this program use a mutex?
3. What is a good host-based signature to use for detecting this program?
4. What is a good network-based signature for detecting this malware?
5. What is the purpose of this program?
6. When will this program finish executing?

# Answers
1. Persistence is achieved through the creation of a service, "MalService", with the start type "SERVICE_AUTO_START" ensuring it's started automatically by the service control manager.
2. A mutex is used to ensure that only one instance of the program is running.
3. The existence of a service named "Malservice" and the program's mutex, called "HGL345", are both host based indicators.
4. A request to the malwareanalysis url the labs often use and the user agent string "Internet Explore 8.0" are network based signtures.
5. The program waits until January 1, 2100 Midnight to send several download requests to the book's malware analysis url, ensuring that each request goes to the origin server and does not download from any cache. This is a DDOS.
6. The program can never finish. It waits until the date and then runs 20 threads, each of which is just and infinite loop of network requests.
