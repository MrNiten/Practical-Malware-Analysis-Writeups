# Lab Questions
1. How does this program achieve persistence to ensure that it continues
running when the computer is restarted?
2. What are two good host-based signatures for this malware?
3. What is the purpose of this program?
4. How could you remove this malware once it is installed?
# Answers
1. This program achieves persistence by writing a DLL to the System32 directory and modifying every .exe file on the system to import that DLL.
2. The presence of a kerne132.dll (note the 132 not L32) on the file system and a mutex named "SADFHUHF" are the host based indicators. You could also get a hash of the binary and use that.
3. The program modifies every executable on the file system to import its own malicious dll which is a backdoor connecting to a remote host. The backdoor can either execute a command or Sleep().
4. It would be best to just restore a backup.
