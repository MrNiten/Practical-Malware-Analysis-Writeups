# Answers
1. An if statement.
2. This is the printf function. Interestingly, sometimes IDA pro just won't recognize it. You can tell it's printf using the context in which the function is used and because the parameter is a string with null terminator.
3. It checks for an internet connection. If there is one, it prints to console "Success: Internet Connection". If not, it will print "Error 1.1: No Internet". The tricky part with this is figuring out that the call after the two message offsets is just the printf function. IDA just doesn't recognize it for some reason.
