# Lab questions
1.  Upload the files to http://www.VirusTotal.com/ and view the reports. Does
either file match any existing antivirus signatures?
2. When were these files compiled?
3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated?
If so, what are these indicators?
4. Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports
are they?
5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for
on infected systems?
6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on
infected machines?
7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?

# Answers
1. Both files match existing antivirus signatures. Virus total indicates they are malicious.
2. Using PE-bear you can find that the files were compiled Sunday 19.12.2010 16:16:19 UTC if you look at the time date stamp in the File Header section.
3. There were no obvious signs of packing or obfuscation.
4. 
* CreateProcessA: Program can create another process, create files, read files by mapping them into the address space of the process, and iterate over files
* WS2-32 calls: indicates potential network functionality
5. The program will create the malicious file "C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll" (note the number 1, kerne 132 .dll) that is used to do its work. This file could be used to detedct this malware on infected machines. The DLL also creates a mutex named "SADFHUHF" which could be used as well.
6. The malware connects to the IP "127.26.152.13". Seeing this in any network logs should indicate this malware is present on a machine connected to the network.
7. The purpose of the files is to backdoor kernel32.dll. The exe installs the malicious DLL which acts as a C2 recieving and sending data to the IP address.
