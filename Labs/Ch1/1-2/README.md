are they and what do they tell you?

malware on infected machines?

# Answers
1. Yes, this matches several signatures.
2. The file is packed with upx according to exe info. There are very few imports, the imports that are there are LoadLibrary, VirtualProtect, etc., and the sections are renamed upx0-2 indicating the program was packed. It can be unpacked by running upx with the d flag.
3. The imports after unpacking provide various hints about the program functionality. CreateService and InternetOpenURL stand out and indicate a service will be created on the machine and an internet URL will be accessed.
4. This program creates a Windows service called "MalService", a mutex named "HGL345" both of which could be host based indicators. The network based indicator is the url the program attempts to access "http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com".
