# Lab Questions
1. Upload the Lab01-04.exe file to http://www.VirusTotal.com/. Does it match
any existing antivirus definitions?
2. Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so,
what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.
3. When was this program compiled?
4. Do any imports hint at this programâ€™s functionality? If so, which imports
are they and what do they tell you?
5. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this
malware on infected machines?
6. This file has one resource in the resource section. Use Resource Hacker
to examine that resource, and then use it to extract the resource. What
can you learn from the resource?

# Answers
1. Yes, this matches several signatures.
2. Nothing indicating packing or obfuscation.
3. The time date stamp from says 30.08.2019 22:26:59 UTC. Knowing when this book was published, that's not possible and the time stamp has been altered.
4. The function imports indicate that the program will be doing file manipulation (Create/Write/MoveFile, GetTempPath, GetWindowsDirectory) and that the user login session will be involved (OpenProcessToken, LookupPrivilegeValue, AdjustTokenPrivileges).
5. The path "\\\system32\\\wupdmgr.exe" can be found in the strings suggesting that the program creates or modifies that file. This could be a host based indicator. The network based indicator would be the url "http://www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com/updater". This can be found with the strings program. My copy of IDA does not find it. Probably because it's found in the resource section of the program.
6. The resource is actually a functioning executable file. It's likely that this is the malicious payload the program saves to the file system.
