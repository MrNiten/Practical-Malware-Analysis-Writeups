# Practical-Malware-Analysis-Writeups

My writups of the labs found in the Practical Malware Analysis book by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig.

I used QEMU/KVM Virtual machines during my lab investigations. The programs I used are typically referenced in the writeups.
I'll update this repo over time.

The book can be found [here](https://nostarch.com/malware).
